# **Employee Experience (EX) analysis in labor social media, applying NLP techniques**
### Data Science Master Final Project

Advanced analytics applied to people changes the paradigm completely. It goes from intuition-based decision making to evidence-based decision making, that means, based on insights provided by data analysis. 

Regarding to solve the purpose of the project and the related questions, in summary, the main goals are the specified below:
- Descriptive analysis using NLP techniques, to find out in which sectors and companies a better employee experience is offered and why. 
- Sentiment analysis (NLU) to score and label the employee sentiments.
- Topic modeling (NLU) to discover which are the most relevant topics for employees in relation to their labor satisfaction and to determinate if their experience has been positive, negative or indiferent. 

The instruction to get the data (drive link) and what dataset I have used throughout the project, is specified in the memory.
